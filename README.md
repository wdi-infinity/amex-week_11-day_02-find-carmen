We're going to use what we've learned and dive deep about searching with Sequelize, to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief, Carmen Sandiego. Follow the clues, and figure out where Carmen's headed, so we can catch her and bring her in.

### Setup/Instructions:

#### Starter Code:

- You've been given a `db` folder that hold all the models and the seeds. All you have to do is colne this repo then

```
npm install
createdb carmen
```

- update the db config.json file then run

```
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```

- You've been given an `index.js` file that has clues for finding Carmen. Read the clues and record your sequelize queries in this file to help you find Carmen and then, tell us where she's heading!!
